Clicking the 'Start' button begins a :30 second timer.  You will also be shown 10 multiple choice trivia
questions.  You will select your answer by selecting a radio button next to your answer. 

When the click on the 'Done' button at the bottom of the page or the timer runs out, you will be directed
to a results page.  This page will display "All Done!" as well as the number of correct answers, incorrect
answers and unanswered questions.
